👋 Hi there! I'm a student at Saylani Mass IT Training, currently learning Web Development.
💻 So far, I’ve completed HTML and CSS, and I’m excited to keep growing my skills in front-end and back-end technologies.
🚀 I love building responsive websites and experimenting with new design ideas.
🌱 Currently learning: JavaScript & modern web frameworks (soon!).
📫 Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me here!
